finding a need to have a <code>CCSprite</code> that would trigger a particular selector.
I wanted something lightweight that I could just throw into anything. So I went
about writing a quick subclass of <code>CCSprite</code> that at first I thought would be a
bit of a throw away one time use thing. It turned out however to be simple and
reusable and I find myself reusing the class all over the place, enter
<code>ClickableSprite</code>.</p><p>The concept is dead simple create a subclass of <code>CCSprite</code> adhering to
<code>CCTargetedTouchDelegate</code>, and give it a couple of properties that will store a
target and selector. Here's the class definition, don't forget to synthesize
those properties though!</p><pre><code class="language-objective-c">@interface ClickableSprite : CCSprite &lt;CCTargetedTouchDelegate&gt; 
 
@property (nonatomic, assign) id&lt;NSObject&gt; target;
@property (nonatomic) SEL selector;
 
@end</code></pre><h3>Handling The Touches</h3><p>In the implementation file we’ll implement a function
(<code>containsTouchLocation:</code>) that will test whether or not a touch is contained
by the sprite. This method was lifted from some place or another, I don't
really remember.</p><pre><code class="language-objective-c">- (BOOL)containsTouchLocation:(UITouch *)touch {
    CGPoint p = [self convertTouchToNodeSpaceAR:touch];
    CGSize size = self.contentSize;
    CGRect r = CGRectMake(-size.width*0.5, 
                          -size.height*0.5, 
                          size.width, 
                          size.height);
    return CGRectContainsPoint(r, p);
}</code></pre><p>Next we want to implement <code>ccTouchBegan:withEvent</code> and <code>ccTouchEnded:withEvent</code>
such that when a user touches the sprite and then lifts their finger without
moving it off of the sprite it will fire it's selector.</p><pre><code class="language-objective-c">- (BOOL)ccTouchBegan:(UITouch *)touch withEvent:(UIEvent *)event {
    return [self containsTouchLocation:touch];
}

- (void)ccTouchEnded:(UITouch *)touch withEvent:(UIEvent *)event {
    if(![self containsTouchLocation:touch])
        return;
    [self.target performSelector:self.selector withObject:self];
}</code></pre><p>Finally we will want to add the sprite as a targeted delegate to the
<code>CCTouchDispatcher</code> singleton, we'll just do this in the <code>onEnter</code>. And of
course we'll want to remove the sprite from the delegate list when it goes away
(otherwise we'll get <code>EXC_BAD_ACCESS</code> when the <code>CCTouchDispatcher</code> tries to get
at it).</p><pre><code class="language-objective-c">- (void)onEnter {
    [super onEnter];
    [[CCTouchDispatcher sharedDispatcher] addTargetedDelegate:self 
                                                     priority:0 
                                              swallowsTouches:YES];
}
 
- (void)onExit {
    [[CCTouchDispatcher sharedDispatcher] removeDelegate:self];
    [super onExit];
}</code></pre><h3>Make That Target Bigger So Your Grandma Can Hit it</h3><p>That's great, it works pretty well, but sometimes you want to be able to press
a sprite that is kind of small, let's just add another property <code>clickableSize</code>
and synthesize it.</p><pre><code class="language-objective-c">@property (nonatomic) CGSize clickableSize;</code></pre><p>Then we can modify our <code>containsTouchLocation</code> function to check for this like
so…</p><pre><code class="language-objective-c">- (BOOL)containsTouchLocation:(UITouch *)touch {
    CGPoint p = [self convertTouchToNodeSpaceAR:touch];
    CGSize size = self.contentSize;
    if(!CGSizeEqualToSize(self.clickableSize, CGSizeZero))
        size = self.clickableSize;
    CGRect r = CGRectMake(-size.width*0.5, 
                          -size.height*0.5, 
                          size.width, 
                          size.height);
    return CGRectContainsPoint(r, p);
}</code></pre><h3>One More Thing</h3><p>Oh, and one more thing you might like is to be able to set the priority.
<code>CCTouchDispatcher</code> will go through all of its delegates in order of priority,
lower being called first. I haven't found that I need to set the priority after
it has been added to the scene so I haven't bothered to implement that
functionality. At any rate we’ll add another property <code>touchPriority</code></p><pre><code class="language-objective-c">@property (nonatomic) int touchPriority;</code></pre><p>And then simply modify our <code>onEnter</code> function</p><pre><code class="language-objective-c">- (void)onEnter {
    [super onEnter];
    [[CCTouchDispatcher sharedDispatcher] addTargetedDelegate:self 
                                                     priority:self.priority
                                              swallowsTouches:YES];
}</code></pre><p>To use the sprite you initialize it as you would a normal <code>CCSprite</code>, set the
relevant properties, and add to a node like any other sprite as well.</p><pre><code class="language-objective-c">ClickableSprite *sprite = [ClickableSprite spriteWithFile:@&quot;myAwesomeSprite.png&quot;];
sprite.target = self;
sprite.selector = @selector(myAwesomeSelector); 
// Or with the sprite as an argument sprite.selector = @selector(myAwesomeSelector:); 
// which would call a function that would look like 
// - (void)myAwesomeSelector:(ClickableSprite *)clickableSprite
sprite.clickableSize = CGSizeMake(100,100);
sprite.touchPriority = 2;</code></pre><p>Now we have a nice simple class that we can reuse over and over again.</p></div></div></body>
