## [@bucketobytes](http://www.rottentomatoes.com) ##
[@bucketobytes](http://www.rottentomatoes.com) is a twitter bot written by Sean Lynch. He is just an experiment to let Sean play around with the twitter api, and exercise some creativity. [Read the blog post.]({% post_url 2013-01-12-my-twitter-bot %})

He is written in python and you can find his source code on GitHub: [seepel/bucketobytes](https://github.com/seepel/bucketobytes). Feel free to fork it, copy/paste it, learn from it, anything you want. I would of course appreciate if didn't use the code to actually spam anyone though, I don't like spam. Remember, with great power comes great responsibility. Below you will find a list of the things @bucketobytes currently does.
