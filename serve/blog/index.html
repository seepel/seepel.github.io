    <h3>Something a Little Bit Different</h3>
<p>Now that I have updated my blog and gotten the <a href="/blog/obligatory-blogging-like-a-hacker-post">Obligatory Blogging Like a Hacker Post</a> out of the way, I would like to introduce you to <a href="https://twitter.com/bucketobytes">@bucketobytes</a>. @bucketobytes is my new twitter bot. Before we get into the details about him, I&#8217;d like to talk about his inspiration. As I was sorting through my <span class="caps">RSS</span> feeds over the holidays I came across <a href="http://randomshopper.tumblr.com">Random Shopper</a>, a bot that Darius Kazemi wrote. Random Shopper is a bot that randomly buys Darius presents on Amazon. I thought &#8220;Well that is just a really cool idea, I wish I had thought of it&#8221;. I then went on a hunt for other bots and came across <a href="https://twitter.com/TicBot">@ticbot</a> and <a href="http://mashable.com/2012/07/22/funny-twitter-bots/">a few others</a>. So I decided I wanted to try my hand at such a thing. So I set out on a quest to build a twitter spam bot, that (hopefully) wouldn&#8217;t actually do any spamming.<p class='more'><a href='/blog/my-twitter-bot'>Read more</a></p>

    <h3>The New Site</h3>
<p>For quite a while I have wanted to redesign my site. I originally set it up with <a href="http://wordpress.org">wordpress</a> as it was easy to get started. I tried various different themes, and even took a look at some of the code in an attempt to make my site my own. What I learned is that while very flexible, wordpress has a lot going on. In the end I found that it was just too complicated for me to dig into the guts and make the changes that I wanted. I came across <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">jekyll</a> and the geek in me said &#8220;Yes! Do it now!&#8221;. I had to exhibit a little self control though as I had a dissertation to write. Incidentally you&#8217;ll notice I haven&#8217;t updated this blog since March, yes it takes a while to write a dissertation and find a job. Now that I&#8217;ve taken care of those two small details I have been able to come back to this site and you can see the end result. Now I know every last little bit of code that goes into this site, and I feel better about that. You&#8217;ll notice that typically when someone switches over to using jekyll they inevitably write a <strong>Blogging Like a Hacker™</strong> post, so I thought I would too. Since there are many out there, I&#8217;ll just post some of my thoughts on the process.<p class='more'><a href='/blog/obligatory-blogging-like-a-hacker-post'>Read more</a></p>

    <h3>Extending CCSprite Makes My Life Easier</h3>
<p>While developing a couple of games that I am currently working on I ended up finding a need to have a CCSprite that would trigger a particular selector. I wanted something lightweight that I could just throw into anything. So I went about writing a quick subclass of CCSprite that at first I thought would be a bit of a throw away one time use thing. It turned out however to be simple and reusable and I find myself reusing the class all over the place, enter ClickableSprite.</p>
<p>The concept is dead simple create a subclass of CCSprite adhering to CCTargetedTouchDelegate, and give it a couple of properties that will store a target and selector.<p class='more'><a href='/blog/extending-cocos2d-ccsprite-to-handle-touches'>Read more</a></p>

  <h2><a href="/blog/using-postgresql-in-lion-server" >Using PostgreSQL included with Lion Server</a></h2>
  <p class="content">
    <p>In Lion Server Apple has moved from MySQL to PostgreSQL. You may find yourself in a situation as I have where you wish to use a web application that requires a database (WordPress for example), but don’t wish to install MySQL when the PostgreSQL server you have will do fine. There are a number of sources out there on how to get this done, but the information seems to be scattered across different corners of the internet. In particular these <a href="http://www.mactasia.co.uk/using-postgresql-in-lion-server">two</a> <a href="https://discussions.apple.com/thread/3199015?start=0&amp;tstart=0">links</a> contain all the information included in this post, but sifting through them was a bit of a pain for me. For this reason I thought I would give my take on how to get this done.<p class='more'><a href='/blog/using-postgresql-in-lion-server'>Read more</a></p>
