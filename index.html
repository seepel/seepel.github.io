"Got Mail?" is a simple application that works in conjunction with the Mac OS X Mail Application. "Got Mail?" allows you to instantly know how many new messages you have in your Inbox with a simple glance at your menu bar. Working feverishly on a project in Photoshop when you see you have a new message? No problem, with a simple click you instantly have a list of your unread messages without missing a beat. If you need to respond to an email, or send a new email it is all just a click away and you don't have to stop what you're doing to hunt down that Mail window. 

"Got Mail?" helps you get your email needs out of the way so you can focus on the important things.
